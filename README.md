## iMaterialist playground

This is just me testing out segmentation on an iMaterialist data.
The original Kaggle competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-fashion-2019-FGVC6).

As you may see I also used an external library by **divamgupta**: [Image Segmentation with keras](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras)

To start out with this project simply type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
